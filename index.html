				<p>So close no matter how far
Couldn't be much more from the heart
Forever trusting who we are
And nothing else matters</p>
				<p>Never opened myself this way
Life is ours, we live it our way
All these words I don't just say
And nothing else matters</p>
				<p>Trust I seek and I find in you
Every day for us something new
Open mind for a different view
And nothing else matters</p>
				<p>Never cared for what they do
Never cared for what they know
But I know</p>
				<p>So close no matter how far
It couldn't be much more from the heart
Forever trusting who we are
And nothing else matters</p>
				<p>Never cared for what they do
Never cared for what they know
But I know</p>
				<p>I never opened myself this way
Life is ours, we live it our way
All these words I don't just say
And nothing else matters</p>
				<p>Trust I seek and I find in you
Every day for us something new
Open mind for a different view
And nothing else matters</p>
				<p>Never cared for what they say
Never cared for games they play
Never cared for what they do
Never cared for what they know
And I know, yeah</p>
				<p>
So close no matter how far
Couldn't be much more from the heart
Forever trusting who we are
No, nothing else matters</p>
